## [Yangguang-Haick](/inventions#nanosensors)

Dr. Chou is a co-founder of Yangguang-Haick, a company developing nano-sensors to detect lung and gastric cancer from exhaled breath.

An IRB-approved preliminary clinical study tested the prototype device on 545 patients with early lung and gastric cancer, showing 100% accuracy and sensitivity. A full-scale multi-center clinical trial is now underway. This device's successful development will enable non-invasive screening and early detection of lung and gastric cancer using just a breath sample.

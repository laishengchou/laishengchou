Three series products including Human Head & Neck PET/CT, human Full-body PET/CT, and a series of animal PET/SPECT/CT have been developed or under development.

### [Human Head and Neck PET/CT Scanner](/inventions#pet-ct-scanners)

<img src="/files/enterprises/image006.jpg">

This device holds the advanced technology leading to 40% increase in resolution and 70% reduction in radiation compared to the market regular PET/CT.  This device has passed all CFDA safety evaluation, and now is under multi-centered clinical trial.

### [Human Full-Body PET/CT Scanner](/inventions#pet-ct-scanners)

<img src="/files/enterprises/image007.jpg">

This device holds the advanced technology leading to 40% increase in resolution and 70% reduction in radiation compared to the market regular PET/CT.  This device is now under CFDA safety evaluation, followed by multi-centered clinical trial.

### [Animal PET/SPECT/CT Series](/inventions#pet-ct-scanners)

<img src="/files/enterprises/image008.jpg">

A series of animal devices of PET/CT, SPECT/CT, PET/SPECT/CT and Micro CT for molecular imaging have been developed in the company with full intellectual properties and distributed to research institutes, pharmaceutical companies, and animal hospitals.  Within three years, this series of products have occupied 60% of market share and became a top brand in the field.

## [Yangguang-Haick](/inventions#nanosensors)

Dr. Chou is a co-founder of Yangguang-Haick, a company developing nano-sensors that can detect lung and gastric cancer from exhaled breath.

<img src="/files/enterprises/image009.jpg">

An IRB-approved preliminary clinical study testing the prototype devise on 545 patients with early lung and gastric cancer has shown 100 percent accuracy and sensitivity. A full-scale multi-centered clinical trial is now underway. The successful development of this devise will lead to non-invasive screening and early detection of lung and gastric cancer based, again, simply on a breath sample.

Dr. Chou has made remarkable cross-disciplinary advances in translational medicine, marked by scientific discoveries and the development of novel medical modalities. These innovations have provided substantial benefits to tens of millions worldwide, especially those afflicted by severe wounds and bone defects. Moreover, through the donation of millions of products to developing countries for individuals facing life-threatening wounds, Dr. Chou's philanthropic efforts have had a profound impact on global health.

In 1995, Dr. Chou was the first to discover [element- and topography-specific biogenetic reactions to inert biomaterials within live human cells](/files/research/biogenetic-reactions-to-inert-biomaterials-1995.pdf). This breakthrough sparked the emergence of the [molecular biocompatibility](/files/research/molecular-biocompatibility-1996.pdf) field. Dr. Chou’s proposal of building the biomaterials’ molecular biocompatibility profile is credited with catalyzing the development of third-generation biomaterials and played a key role in shaping the federal white paper <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/materials_genome_initiative-final.pdf">"Materials Genome Initiative"</a> issued by President Obama in 2011.

Dr. Chou's groundbreaking research on Si/Ca-containing epitheliogenic materials paved the way for the creation of FDA-, CFDA-, or CE-approved wound-healing medications, protected by 56 patents. By February 2024, these medications have effectively treated 16,503,900 patients suffering from severe bedsores, donor-skin loss, deep burns, delayed-healing wounds, and diabetic foot ulcers. Additionally, Dr. Chou's philanthropic efforts include the donation of 1,679,868 packaged products to regions in Africa and other developing nations, providing crucial aid to individuals with life-threatening wounds.

##	<a name="3d-scaffolds"></a> [The First 3D Printing Device for Tissue Engineering and First Biomimetically Engineered Scaffold Benefiting Over a Hundred Thousand Patients](/files/research/osteobone.pdf)

In 1998, Dr. Chou uncovered the osteogenic properties of inorganic silicon, along with its synergistic relationship with calcium. His pioneering work included the development of the world's first 3-D printing method for tissue engineering in 1995. This breakthrough culminated in the creation of the first CFDA-approved biomimetically engineered osteogenic scaffold for treating severe bone defects. As of February 2024, this scaffold has facilitated bone regeneration in 142,750 patients, boasting nearly zero short- or long-term failure rates based on over 20 years of post-operative monitoring.

Around 20% of the world's population suffers from recurrent oral ulcers, a condition for which, prior to 2006, steroid use was the primary treatment option despite associated side effects. In 2006, Dr. Chou introduced the first silicon delivery patch, approved by FDA, CFDA, or CE, for faster healing of oral ulcers without relying on steroids. As of February 2024, 1,801,013 patients have benefited from this innovative product for managing recurrent oral ulcers.

## <a name="pet-ct-scanners"></a> [The First Head and Neck PET/CT System for Better Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer Patients](/files/research/pingseng.pdf)

In 2016, Dr. Chou and his team introduced the first Head and Neck PET-CT scanner, tailored for diagnosing and monitoring head and neck cancer. Their efforts yielded 55 patents, spanning the scanner's distinctive signaling system and design, which achieves twice the resolution with 70 percent less radiation compared to existing full-body PET-CT scans. This design enables immediate assessment of surgical outcomes following tumor removal in the head and neck region. There is additional potential to address diagnostic gaps in Alzheimer’s disease and monitoring treatment progress. Clinical trials under CFDA approval are forthcoming for this scanner.

##	<a name="nanosensors"></a> [The First Nano-Sensor to Detect the Early-Stage Lung and Gastric Cancer from a Breath Sample](/files/research/nanosensors.pdf)

Dr. Chou has led a team in developing a novel breath test nano-sensor device for the early detection of lung and gastric cancer. With 42 patents to its name, this technology detects trace biochemical markers of cancer cells, even before clinical symptoms appear. An initial clinical study, approved by the IRB and involving 545 patients with early-stage lung and gastric cancers, demonstrated 100 percent accuracy and sensitivity. A larger clinical trial is currently in progress. The device's successful development could revolutionize cancer screening by offering a non-invasive method based on a simple breath sample.
